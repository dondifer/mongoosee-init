In this project we wil uses express and mongoose to acreat an API for a social network.


## How to start
First of all we have to set up a mongoose account config to make it work. 

[Getting started width mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/)

After creating **mongoDB** cluster and accout we have to clone te repo and set up this in *'.config'* file

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dondifer/mongoosee-init.git
 ```

```bash
module.exports = {
MONGO_URI: 'mongodb+srv://<name>:<password>@cluster0-tuqrv.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
}
```
Where name and password are personal data of **mongoDB** cluster

After that we should import project collection in **postman** to be able to fill the database, after that we will proceed to instalation.
